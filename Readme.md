# Nexora – My Backend Learning Project 

This repository is the result of my deep dive into backend development using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  
Instead of just tutorials, I built a **fully functional video and tweet sharing platform backend** to understand real-world concepts like authentication, authorization, file handling, and database relationships.

>  This project was not just about building features — it was about understanding **why and how** things work under the hood.

I documentend everything I learned through the project **[here](https://github.com/SadikRahman14/Nexora/blob/main/Notes.md)**

##  Why This Repo Exists

I wanted to:
- Move beyond CRUD tutorials
- Master Express middlewares, controllers, and route structuring
- Learn to model data and handle relationships in MongoDB
- Understand authentication, file uploads, and REST principles


## Features
-  JWT-based Authentication (Login/Register)
-  Upload, Edit, Delete Videos
-  Comment System (CRUD)
-  Like System (Videos, Comments, Tweets)
-  Playlist Management
-  Channel Stats (views, subscribers, likes)

## Postman Testing
All the routes and controllers have been tested in **Postman**. The json file is uploaded in project : **[Nexora.postman_collection.json](https://github.com/SadikRahman14/Nexora/blob/main/Nexora.postman_collection.json)**
